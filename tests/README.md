This folder contains some test cases to check Quincy's functionality. The test cases are just for Windows XP due to space restrictions. To run the tests, just run:

``
python quincy_test.py
``

Please note that the model winxp_sp2_without_spyeye_teerac_zeus.json was computed without the test families. However, we used undersampling to quickly compute the model. 
This model may result in false positives. Just use it for testing purposes. Use the precomputed models in code/models instead.
