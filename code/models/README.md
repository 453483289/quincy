# Precomputed machine learning models
This folder contains precomputed machine learning models for Quincy. We created these models based on the following Windows versions:

- Windows XP SP2
- Windows 7 SP1
- Windows 10

They may help to quickly utilize Quincy. However, we would like to stress that the best results are achieved with your own models (use QuincyLearn.py).
Models that you create based on your use case/environment most likely increase Quincy's detection performance in comparison to the aforementioned precomputed models.
